# ArcGIS
Screenshots and files that I am collecting as I learn and complete work using ArcGIS.


![ArcGIS USA State Populations](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4defd963-94e5-4598-b7b6-8d9560fb93d4)
In the screenshot above, I added a USA states feature layer to a map in ArcGIS, and had each state display its "2023 population" value using bubbles.  Smaller bubbles indicate a smaller population and larger bubbles indicate a larger population.


![ArcGIS geocoding San Bernardino County Post Offices](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be6a97cb-63d5-4dbd-a9c0-92617ef0a983)
In the above screenshot, I loaded a table of post offices in San Bernardino County with their addresses to ArcGIS Pro.  I used a global address locating database to "geocode" the post office addresses and mark all post offices from the table onto the map.
