# ArcGIS
Screenshots and files that I am collecting as I learn and complete work using ArcGIS.

In the screenshot below, I added a USA states feature layer to a map in ArcGIS, and had each state display its "2023 population" value using bubbles.  Smaller bubbles indicate a smaller population and larger bubbles indicate a larger population.

In this screenshot below, I loaded a table of post offices in San Bernardino County with their addresses to ArcGIS Pro.  I used a global address locating database to "geocode" the post office addresses and mark all post offices from the table onto the map.

Below is a screenshot of a layout file that I made, displaying a breakdown of survey responses from 2010 for each state in the U.S. in the form of mini pie charts.

Below is another layout file that I made, displaying differing percentages of survey respondents from 2009 for each state who indicated that they smoke every day.
